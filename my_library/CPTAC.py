# Define the path to the MIL (Multiple Instance Learning) project directory to work with CPTAC slides
project_path = "projects/mil_project"

# Note: To make this into an absolute path, you could combine it with your working_directory:
# full_project_path = os.path.join(working_directory, project_path)
# This would be useful if you need to ensure the path works from any working directory
